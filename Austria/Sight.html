              Entering Schönbrunn Palace is like entering a fantasy world. In
              the seventeenth century, it was converted from a hunting lodge
              into a spectacular baroque house.

          It's difficult to comprehend its immense size with 1,440 rooms The
          State Apartments, the Hall of Mirrors, and the Great Gallery are a few
          of the most striking spaces. Beautiful frescoes, glistening
          chandeliers, and minute decorations abound throughout every room.
          However, the palace is more than just its apartments. The gardens,
          which feature exquisite fountains, statues, and well kept grass, are
          similarly magnificent. Imagine discovering hidden passageways,
          meandering through a flower filled maze, and discovering exquisite
          sculptures everywhere you look. On the grounds of the palace sits the
          oldest zoo in the world, Tiergarten Schönbrunn.
