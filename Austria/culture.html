            <div class="grid-item item3" style="background-color: #ccc;">                <p>Naturalismens plays a big role in the development in austrian literature in late XIX-XX. Ludwig Anzengruber was an Austrian dramatist and novelist that made great contributions to Austrian literature by writing the iconic “The Priest from Kirchfeld” “The Perjurer” and “The Fourth Commandment” and therefore revealing problems of the lower class population. But austrian literature changed with time and was highly impacted by the western culture, which triggered its transformation into a Impressionism and Neoromanticism. The founder of this movement was Hermann Bahr, an Austrian writer, director, and critic, who also started a society of writers named Jung-Wien. The result of this was promoting new ideas and styles that contrasted with the preceding Naturalist tradition.</p></div>
            <div class="grid-item item4" style="background-color: #ccc;"><p>Bah’s influence extended beyond his own works, as he trained a new generation of writers who embraced the themes of Impressionism and Neo-Romanticism. In order to give a more precise example of this phenomenon, it will be a greater idea to give a comparison of Austrian literature with literature in its other stage, when it is under the strong influence of religion. In this case, the attention was paid to God rather than to man. And during this heyday of Austrian literature, increased attention was paid to the inner world, emotions and perceptions of a person, reflecting a broader European trend towards exploring the complexities of human psychology and experience. Works created by Jung-Wen members often showed a preoccupation with beauty. Such a step in the development of Austrian literature could not but leave a mark on the very culture of this country, because, as follows from the example above, the population of Austria began to change its behavior towards the East and religion, and its morality took second place compared to the ideas of individual freedom and independence from the church.

            <div class="grid-item item9" style="background-color: #ccc;"><p>Another important aspect of Austrian culture is food. One iconic dish that represents the heart of Austrian culinary tradition is Wiener Schnitzel. This beloved delicacy consists of a thinly pounded veal or pork cutlet, coated in breadcrumbs and fried to golden perfection. Served with a slice of lemon and a side of potato salad or lingonberry sauce, Wiener Schnitzel embodies the rich flavors and heritage of Austrian cuisine. Its crispy exterior and tender meat make it a staple on Austrian menus and a favorite among locals and visitors alike.</p></div>
